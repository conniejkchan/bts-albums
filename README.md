# Drawing on the Web
## BTS Top 3 Album Favorites

For my final project I am planning to dedicate the three web pages to my top three favorite BTS albums. I am a big fan of the Korean boy group, BTS, and with my past assignments for this class as well, I've been using the group as an inspiration. As a final dedication to my appreciation for the members of the group, their music, and the messages they wish to show to the world, I decided to cover the many themes and imagery that go into some of my favorite BTS albums.

In chronological order, my first drawing will be on the album The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever. To end their trilogy of The Most Beautiful Moment in Life albums, BTS puts out 3 new songs, Young Forever, Save Me, and Fire. The music videos for each of these songs consisted of many meaningful imagery to convey the message of this album “to move on from the tough times and escape it to continue living life as while you’re young enjoy the youth as well. Some symbolic imagery I will have on the web page is the airplane on a landing stripe flying to “heaven” where they can finally be happy. There’s also a song called “Butterfly” in the album which I will include on this webpage.

For the second drawing, it will be based on my second favorite album called “You Never Walk Alone”. Some important symbols comes from the “Spring Day” music which features a train, a book titled “Omelas”, and a scenic scene by the beach.

For the third drawing, it will be on my third favorite album called “Love Yourself: Answer”. My favorite songs on the album is Euphoria, Seesaw, and Answer: Love Myself. On this page, I will have drawings related to my favorite tracks on this album.
